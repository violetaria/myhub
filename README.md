# Myhub

Created a simple website which allows a user to look at their Github Issues and interact with them.  Users can change issues from open to close with the click of a button.  Made using Sinatra and HTTParty.

## Usage

Note: Users must set their Github AUTH_TOKEN via environment variable.

Start the server by using bundle: `AUTH_TOKEN=<YOUR_GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN> bundle exec ruby lib/myhub.rb`
